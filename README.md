# Football Matches Analysis with YOLOv8

This repository hosts the code and documentation for a deep learning project aimed at analyzing football matches. The project utilizes YOLOv8 for object detection tasks, identifying elements such as players, the ball, and other relevant objects within a video stream. The model is trained on a comprehensive dataset of football matches and fine-tuned to adapt to indoor football environments.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a robust model capable of detecting various objects in football matches with high accuracy, which can be used to analyze player movements, game strategies, and ball positioning. This analysis could be beneficial for coaching, player development, and enhanced viewer experiences.

### Technologies Used
- **YOLOv8**: An advanced deep learning model for object detection tasks.
- **Roboflow**: A tool used for managing and annotating datasets.
- **Ultralytics**: This framework provides the implementation for YOLOv8 and tools for training and evaluating deep learning models.

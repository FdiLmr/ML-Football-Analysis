# Football Matches Analysis with YOLOv8

This repository hosts the code and documentation for a deep learning project aimed at analyzing football matches. The project utilizes YOLOv8 for object detection tasks, identifying elements such as players, the ball, and other relevant objects within a video stream.
The goal of this project is to create a robust model capable of detecting various objects in football matches with high accuracy, which can be used to analyze player movements, game strategies, and ball positioning. This analysis could be beneficial for coaching, player development, and enhanced viewer experiences.

## Project Overview

This project implements a video processing pipeline that tracks objects (such as players and a ball) in a video, estimates their movements, and visualizes the results. The main components of the pipeline are as follows:

### Overview

1. **Video Input**: The process begins by reading a video file containing the footage to be analyzed. The video is loaded frame by frame for further processing.
2. **Object Tracking**: Using a pre-trained model, the system identifies and tracks various objects in the video frames. This includes players and the ball, with the ability to handle multiple objects simultaneously.
3. **Position Estimation**: The tracker adds positional data to each tracked object, allowing for a detailed analysis of their movements throughout the video.
4. **Camera Movement Estimation**: The system estimates the camera's movement between frames, which is crucial for accurately interpreting the positions of the tracked objects relative to each other.
5. **View Transformation**: The positions of the tracked objects are transformed to account for camera movement, ensuring that the visualizations are accurate and meaningful.
6. **Ball Position Interpolation**: The system interpolates the positions of the ball to fill in any gaps in tracking data, providing a continuous representation of its movement.
7. **Speed and Distance Estimation**: The speed and distance traveled by each tracked object are calculated and added to their respective data. This information is crucial for performance analysis, especially in sports contexts.
8. **Team Assignment**: The system assigns team colors to players based on their positions and interactions in the video, enhancing the visual representation of the data.
9. **Ball Assignment**: The system determines which player has control of the ball at any given time, allowing for a better understanding of gameplay dynamics.
10. **Visualization**: The processed frames are annotated with the tracked positions, speed, distance, and team colors. This visualization is crucial for analyzing the performance of players and the flow of the game.
11. **Video Output**: Finally, the annotated frames are compiled into a new video file, which is saved for further review and analysis.
